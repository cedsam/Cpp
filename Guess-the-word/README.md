# Guess-the-word

My first C++ program before I learn the oriented object programming. The idea belong to Mathieu NEBRA.

## Goal of guess the word
It can be pretty obvious but:
The program use a dictionary file, pick a random word, and scramble it.
You have 5 try to guess the mixed word, and you can play as much as you want.
